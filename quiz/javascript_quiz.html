    <h2> Javascript Exercises</h2>

    <p><strong>1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
        <br> setTimeout(booyah, 2000); <br>
        setTimeout(booyah(), 2000); 
    </strong></p>
    <p>
        setTimeout(booyah, 2000);  - Executes booyah function after 2000ms. <br>
        setTimeout(booyah(), 2000); - Executes booyah function right away and setTimeout does not work.
    </p>
    <p><strong>2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
        <pre>
        var myfunc = function(a, x) {
         return a * x;
        };
        var x = myfunc(2, 3);
        var y = myfunc;
        alert(x);
        alert(y(2,3)); </pre></strong></p>
    <p>
        6 and 6.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that
        says “BOOYAH!”
        <br>
        setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
        <br>setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);</strong></p>
    <p>
        <pre>
        function booyah1() {
            console.log("booyah");
        }
        
        function booyah2() {
            setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
        }
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p><strong>4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
        for using it)?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Unobtrusive JavaScript is a general approach to the use of JavaScript in web pages.  
        Website, and it’s content, should still be accessible when JavaScript is unavailable and 
        the only way to guarantee this is by employing Unobtrusive JavaScript techniques.
        <br>
        Adding JavaScript to your site should be an additive process, bringing better experiences to 
        those who have the capabilities of running your code, not a destructive one for
        those who for whatever reason have JavaScript disabled or blocked or not fully implemented. 
        This is called Progressive Enhancement.     
        <br>
        Simple practical ways would be including JavaScript at the end of your html file. 
        And remove all the JavaScript codes from your html and move them into JavaScript files.
