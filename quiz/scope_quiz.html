    <h2> Javascript Scope Exercises </h2>
    <p><strong> 1. Determine what this Javascript code will print out (without running it):
            <pre>
                x = 1;
                var a = 5;
                var b = 10;
                var c = function(a, b, c) {
                    var x = 10; 
                    document.write(x); 
                    document.write(a);
                    var f = function(a, b, c) {
                        b = a; 
                        document.write(b); 
                        b = c;
                        var x = 5;
                    }
                    f(a,b,c);
                    document.write(b);
                }
                c(8,9,10); 
                document.write(b); 
                document.write(x);
            }
        </pre>
        </strong></p>
    <p>
        Result: 10, 8, 8, 9, 9, 1
    </p>
    <p><strong>2. What is the difference between a method and function?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Objects' methods run inside that object.
    </p>
    <p><strong>3. What does 'this' refer to when used in a Java method?</strong></p>
    <p>
        This refers to an instance variable of current class.
    </p>
    <p><strong>4. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript method?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Inside an object's method, the object refers to itself as this.
    </p>
    <p><strong>5. What does 'this' refer to when used in a JavaScript constructor function?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Refers to itself as this.
    </p>
    <p><strong>6. Assume object x is the prototype for object y in Javascript. Object x has a method f( ) containing
            keyword 'this'.
            When f is called by x.f( ), what does 'this' refer to?</strong></p>
    <p>
        This refers to x;
    </p>
    <p><strong>7. What is a free variable in JavaScript?</strong></p>
    <p>
        Free variables are the variables that are neither locally declared nor passed as parameter. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>8. Create an object that has properties with name = "fred" and major="music" and a property that is a
            function
            that takes 2 numbers and returns the smallest of the two, or the square of the two if they are
            equal.</strong></p>
    <p>
        <pre>var object = {
            name: "fred",
            major: "music",
            smallest: function(a, b) {
                if(a == b) return Math.sqrt(a+b);
              if (a > b) return b;
              return a;
            }
          }</pre>
    </p>
    <p><strong>9. Write Javascript code for creating three Employee objects using the "new" keyword and a constructor
            function.
            Employee objects have the following fields: name, salary, position.</strong></p>
    <p>
        <pre>
            function Employee(name, salary, position) {
                this.name = name;
                this.salary = salary;
                this.position = position;
              }
              console.log(
                new Employee("George", 5000, "CEO")
              );
              console.log(
                new Employee("Laura", 3000, "Janitor")
              );
              console.log(
                new Employee("Tom", 900, "Security")
              );
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p><strong>10. Write a Javascript function that takes any number of input arguments and returns the product of the
            arguments.</strong></p>
    <p>
        <pre>
            function findMax() {
                var i;
                var total = 1;
                for (i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
                    total = total * arguments[i];
                }
                console.log(total); 
                return total;
              }
              var x = findMax(1, 2, 5, 9); // 
              var x = findMax(5, 3, 2); // 
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p><strong>
            11. Write an arrow function that returns the maximum of its three input arguments.</strong></p>
    <p>
        <pre>
            var findMax = (a, b, c) => {
                var i;
                var max = a;
                if(b > max) max = b;
                if(c > max) max = c;
                return max;
              }
              var x = findMax(1, 9, 5); // 
              console.log(x);
              var x = findMax(5, 3, 2); // 
              console.log(x);
        </pre>
    </p>
